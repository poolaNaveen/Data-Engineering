        "## 1. Fundamentals and Syntax\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Variables and Data Types:** Understanding basic data types like **integers** ($int$), **floating-point numbers** ($float$), **strings** ($str$), and **booleans** ($bool$).\n",
        "* **Operators:** Learning about **arithmetic** ($+$, $-$, $*$, $/$, $\\%$, $**$), **comparison** ($==$, $!=$, $>$, $<$, $>=$, $<=$,), and **logical** ($and$, $or$, $not$) operators.\n",
        "* **Control Flow:** Mastering **conditional statements** ($if$, $elif$, $else$) and **loops** ($for$ and $while$) to control program execution.\n",
        "* **Basic I/O:** Reading input from the user and printing output to the console.\n",

        "* **Tuples:** Ordered, immutable (unchangeable) sequences of items (e.g., `(10, 20, 30)`).\n",
        "* **Dictionaries:** Unordered collections of **key-value pairs** (e.g., `{'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}`).\n",
        "* **Sets:** Unordered collections of **unique** items.\n",

        "* **Scope:** Understanding **Local, Enclosing, Global, and Built-in (LEGB)** scope rules.\n",
        "* **Modules and Packages:** Organizing code into **modules** ($files$) and **packages** ($directories$) for better structure and using the $import$ statement.\n",

        "    * **Inheritance:** Creating new classes based on existing ones to reuse code.\n",
        "    * **Polymorphism:** The ability of an object to take on many forms (often through method overriding).\n",

        "* **Context Managers:** Using the $with$ statement for safe resource management (like file closing).\n",

        "* **Decorators:** Functions that modify or enhance other functions.\n",
        "* **Standard Library:** Utilizing Python's extensive built-in modules (e.g., $os$, $sys$, $math$, $datetime$).\n",
        "* **External Libraries:** Working with popular third-party libraries based on the application area:\n",
        "    * **Data Science/Analysis:** **NumPy** (numerical operations), **Pandas** (data manipulation).\n",
